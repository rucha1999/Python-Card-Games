# Python-Card-Games
Implemented 3 Card Games

Since childhood I have been fond of playing cards, fascinated by different types of games. The fact that I was very skilled and occasionally fortunate in my dealings contributed to some of the affection as well. As I learned coding in Python. I always wanted to try make card games in python. I have taken three of my favorite card games and have tried to execute them in python.

The First card game is “Black Jack”, which is also called “21” because the cards in the hand of player must be close or equal to number 21. It is a relatively simple yet engaging game with higher chance of winning is when you get lucky with the cards.

The Second card game is “WAR”, in this game player starts with half of the deck and they play a card from the top of their deck each turn. The round is won by the person who has the highest card value. In the event of a tie, the players proceed to "war," in which each player deals three additional cards face down before dealing a final card. All cards played in that round are won by the person whose face-up card value is higher. The implemented code has the basics of the game but does not include ability to “SLAP” the deck which is also one of the nuances of the traditional game.

The Third and the final game is “JOKER” in which player 2 player plays till one of them gets joker. The player that gets joker wins. I have kept second player as the computer itself. The game continues until either the player or the computer has no cards left in their hand. At that point, the player with cards remaining is declared the winner.
